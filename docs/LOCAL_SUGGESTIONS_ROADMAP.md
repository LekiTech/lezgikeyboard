# Local-First Suggestions Roadmap

Plan for making word suggestions smarter by learning from the user's own
typing — entirely on device. The keyboard keeps working without Full Access,
without any server, and without uploading typed text. This document is a
roadmap only; nothing here is implemented until its stage begins.

## Privacy Principles

These hold for every stage below:

- **No Full Access required** — the keyboard never asks for it during normal
  setup, and every learning feature works without it.
- **No network by default** — without Full Access, iOS itself denies the
  keyboard any network access; privacy is enforced by the OS, not by promise.
- **No server by default** — there is no server-side learning component.
- **No uploading typed text** — nothing the user types leaves the device.
- **No full sentence storage** — only individual words and word pairs
  (bigrams) are ever stored, never sentences or message text.
- **All normal learning stays on device** — learned data lives in the
  keyboard extension's own sandbox container and is deleted with the app.

Background: without Full Access a keyboard extension has no shared container
with its containing app, but it does have its own container it can write to
([Apple: Custom Keyboard](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html),
[Configuring open access](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/configuring-open-access-for-a-custom-keyboard)).
That is where all learned data lives. In secure (password) fields iOS
replaces custom keyboards with the system one, so passwords are never seen.

## Stage 1 — Local learned word frequency

- [x] Create `learned.sqlite` in the keyboard extension's own container
      (`Application Support`, WAL mode, schema version in a `meta` table)
- [x] Store individual learned words only — no sentences, no context text
- [x] Track per word: `word`, `count`, `picked` (times chosen from the
      suggestion bar), `last_used` timestamp
- [x] Learn when a word is completed (space / punctuation / return after it)
- [x] Learn with extra weight when a suggestion is selected from the bar
- [x] Merge learned words into the current prefix-based suggestions from
      `lezgi_words.sqlite`
- [x] Boost learned words in ranking; boost picked words above merely typed
      ones
- [x] Words are stored from the first use; the visibility threshold is
      user-adjustable (fast 1 / normal 3 / conservative 5) — only the
      threshold changes, never the learning itself. The product default is
      fast (1): words surface immediately, and the stricter thresholds
      remain available as typo protection
- [x] Suggestions follow the capitalization context (sentence start, empty
      field, Shift, Caps Lock) — consistently for learned and dictionary words
- [x] Long-press on a learned suggestion offers to remove it from
      `learned.sqlite` via an inline confirmation row inside the suggestion
      bar. Dictionary suggestions are never deleted — if a word exists in
      both, only the learned record goes. (UIKit alerts must not be presented
      from a keyboard extension: the restricted environment kills the
      keyboard and iOS falls back to another one — first attempt used an
      alert and hit exactly that.)

### Immediate send (mostly covered)

If the user types a word and immediately taps the app's own **Send** button
(no space, punctuation, or return after the word), extensions get no "will
send" hook — but messengers clear the field after sending, and that
host-driven clear is observable: `textDidChange` fires with a completely
empty document while the locally tracked composed word is still non-empty,
which commits the word (see CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md, "Immediate send").
Return-key sends were always covered. Remaining gap: hosts that do not
clear the field on send (e.g. a closing mail composer) still give no
signal, and no fragile workaround is attempted for them.

## Stage 2 — Cleanup / limits

- [x] Prune old and rare learned words when caps are exceeded
- [x] Decay counters over time (e.g., halve all counts when the total event
      counter passes a threshold) so stale habits fade out
- [x] Enforce size limits for `learned.sqlite` (target: a few MB at most,
      hard cap on row counts)
- [x] Do not learn emails, URLs, tokens with digits, or very short tokens
      (fewer than 2 characters)

## Stage 3 — Local bigrams

- [x] Store previous word + current word pairs with counts
      (`prev`, `word`, `count`, `last_used`)
- [x] Use bigrams to rank suggestions by the word before the cursor
      (taken from `documentContextBeforeInput`, which iOS already truncates
      to roughly the current sentence)
- [x] Use bigrams only locally — same container, same deletion rules
- [x] No full sentences stored — a bigram is two words and a counter,
      nothing more

## Stage 4 — Next-word suggestions

- [x] When the prefix is empty right after a space, suggest likely next
      words instead of showing nothing
- [x] Rank by bigrams for the previous word first; when there is no last
      word or no confident pairs (a pair must be seen at least twice), the
      bar keeps the random dictionary fallback

## Stage 5 — Reset learned data

- [x] Add a way to reset learned suggestions from inside the keyboard
      (learned data lives in the keyboard's sandbox, so the reset control
      must be in the keyboard itself — the containing app cannot reach it
      without Full Access). Implemented as a gear key in the bottom row
      that opens the in-keyboard settings panel: its «Гафарган» page lists
      the learned words with per-word deletion, and «Вири чирнавай гафар
      чӏурун» wipes everything behind an in-panel confirmation sheet —
      suggestions refresh immediately
- [x] Document the privacy behavior clearly in the app and README: what is
      stored, where it lives, that deleting the app deletes it, and how to
      reset it manually (README keyboard section, the app's privacy feature
      card, and docs/CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md)

## Architecture note — the dictionary base-score contract

A foundational decision for the ranking engine, recorded here so it is
never re-litigated ad hoc. The bundled dictionary is the beginning of a
language model, not a word list — and its ranking signal is governed by
this contract:

- The bundled dictionary should eventually expose an opaque **`baseScore`**
  (or equivalent ranking value) — deliberately *not* a "frequency" field.
- The suggestion engine treats this value as a **read-only ordering
  signal** supplied by the language model, with no assumptions about how
  it was produced.
- The source of `baseScore` may evolve — frequency corpus, aggregated
  cloud statistics, a future language model — **without any change to the
  ranking engine**.
- With no ranking data the behavior falls back gracefully to the current
  implementation: effectively `baseScore = 0` for every entry (ordering
  degrades to the present length-based one).
- `baseScore` belongs exclusively to the bundled/global language model and
  is **never modified on the device**; updates arrive only as whole
  dictionary replacements (see Stage 8).
- Personal learning (`learned.sqlite`) stays completely separate and
  continues to hold only user-specific data.
- The ranking engine must **never numerically combine `baseScore` with
  personal learning counters** — no `finalScore = baseScore + 3·count +
  5·picked` style blending, however tempting. The two are measured on
  unrelated, independently drifting scales (decay halves personal
  counters; server updates renormalize global scores), so any arithmetic
  mix silently changes meaning over time. The only sanctioned interaction
  between the sources is the existing *ordering-level* merge (learned
  candidates rank above dictionary candidates). If a unified ranking ever
  becomes necessary, the global language model must provide it explicitly,
  shipping ready-made data to the device — the device never reconciles
  heterogeneous scores on its own.

## Stage 6 — Optional future local improvements

- [ ] `UILexicon` integration — **postponed, research-only.** Although it
      is available without Full Access, it is likely a poor default fit for
      a Lezgi Cyrillic keyboard: contact names and text replacements are
      often English/Russian/other languages and would pollute Lezgi
      suggestions. If ever revisited, it needs separate research and must
      be optional (off by default), not a default behavior
- [ ] Ranking weight tuning (context vs. personal frequency vs. base
      dictionary)
- [ ] Better recency scoring (exponential decay on `last_used` instead of a
      simple boost)
- [x] Local-only diagnostics: five meta-table counters (opportunities,
      accepted, typed manually, ignored, corrected) with acceptance rate
      in a DEBUG-only startup log — kept on device, never transmitted,
      independent of ranking and learning. The baseline for every ranking
      change that follows (see CODEBASE_OVERVIEW, "Local quality metrics")

## Stage 7 — Optional Full Access / improvement mode

**This is NOT required for the keyboard to work.** Future idea only — no
part of it may begin without researching Apple's privacy and App Store
requirements first.

- [ ] An optional, user-controlled setting for people who explicitly want to
      help improve the keyboard
- [ ] Strictly opt-in; the keyboard must fully work without it
- [ ] Do not request Full Access during normal setup
- [ ] Do not scare users with the Full Access prompt unless there is a
      clear, privacy-safe feature behind it
- [ ] Clearly explain what enabling it does and does not do
- [ ] Provide a way to turn it off
- [ ] Provide a way to delete/reset any learned data
- [ ] Any future network-based improvement must avoid full sentences and
      sensitive data (aggregated word statistics at most)
- [ ] Research Apple privacy / App Store Review requirements (privacy
      nutrition labels, data collection disclosure) before implementation

## Stage 8 — Cloud sync and the split language model (future architecture)

**High-priority architectural milestone — not an implementation task.**
Nothing here is scheduled; this section exists so the learning engine is
never redesigned into a corner. As the keyboard grows, this becomes one of
the most important features, so every change to the learning engine from
now on must stay compatible with the design below.

The core decision: **SQLite databases are never synchronized directly.**
The architecture distinguishes two language models with different owners:

- **Personal language model** — each user's learned vocabulary and bigrams.
  It belongs to the user, syncs across their devices through their account,
  and is never merged into anyone else's model. The on-device
  `learned.sqlite` becomes a device-local cache of this model.
- **Global language model** — dictionaries, bigrams, and ranking data
  shared by everyone, maintained **only** by the server. Devices never
  modify it directly.

Data flows in events, not databases:

- Devices upload **learning events** (new word seen, word learned, bigram
  observed, frequency updates, suggestion accepted, …) — never full
  sentences, never message text, consistent with the privacy principles at
  the top of this document.
- The server aggregates events across many users and alone decides what
  eventually enters the global model. A word joins it only after
  sufficient aggregated evidence, so personal names, typos, and one-off
  rare words never pollute the shared dictionary.
- The keyboard periodically downloads updated global dictionaries,
  bigrams, and language-model data, while each user's private learned
  vocabulary stays separate — exactly the split the suggestion pipeline
  already has today (bundled dictionary vs. `learned.sqlite`). The
  dictionary's `baseScore` (see the architecture note before Stage 6) is
  the field these global-model updates ship in.

Why today's design is already compatible — and must remain so:

- The local store keeps exactly event-shaped facts (word + counters,
  bigram + counter, picked/typed distinction, recency) and no sentences —
  each row can be replayed as an upload event later.
- The suggestion pipeline already merges two sources with the bundled
  dictionary read-only; a server-updated global model slots into the same
  seam the static dictionary occupies now.
- Anything that would blur the personal/global boundary on device (e.g.,
  writing learned words into the bundled dictionary, or making ranking
  depend on mutating shared data) is off the table.

Prerequisites when this ever starts: an account system, and everything
Stage 7 lists — strict opt-in, full offline operation without it, and the
Apple privacy / App Store Review research done first.
